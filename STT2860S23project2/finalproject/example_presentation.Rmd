## Packages Used

I used tidyverse for data manipulation and plotting.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

I need mapdata to plot on a map of the United States.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(mapdata)
```

I need scales to format a percentage axis.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(scales)
```

## Capital Punishment Dataset

I compiled my dataset using several sources found at the web site of the nonprofit [Death Penalty Information Center](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/). The dataset was last updated January 7, 2022, so some of the values may have changed between that date and now. 

**Variables in the Dataset:**

* `state`: state name (including District of Columbia)
* `region`: US Census region
* `division`: US Census regional subdivision
* `court`: US Court of Appeals regional circuit
* `dp1`: whether the state legally has the death penalty (yes/no)
* `dp2`: dp1, but indicates states with a governorâ€™s moratorium  

## 

* `abolished`: year the state abolished capital punishment
* `post1976`: number of executions after 1976 (state only)
* `pre1976`: executions before 1976 (may include fed/military)
* `prisoners`: total number of prisoners currently on death row
* `women`: number of women on death row (subset of prisoners)
* `freed`: number of innocent people later freed from death row
* `clemency`: number of people who were granted clemency
* `life`: can the state sentence an adult to life without parole?
* `lifejuvie`: can a juvenile get a life without parole sentence?
* `felony`: can you get the death penalty as a felony accessory?
* `sentence`: who makes the decision about whether someone gets the death penalty?

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7.5, fig}
ggplot(data, aes(x = dp2, fill = dp2)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("no death penalty", "death penalty", "in moratorium*")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 4), limits = c(0, 28)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "How many U.S. states have the death penalty?",
    subtitle = "Data includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia",
    caption = "*death penalty is legal but currently under governor's moratorium",
    x = NULL,
    y = "number of states"
  )
```

This is a serviceable plot, but kind of bland, right?

##

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7.5}
ggplot(data, aes(x = region, fill = dp2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", width = 0.5) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(
    "Midwest\n(12 states)",
    "Northeast\n(9 states)",
    "South\n(17 states)",
    "West\n(13 states)"
  )) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1),
    labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100)
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(
    palette = "Set2",
    labels = c("no death penalty", "death penalty", "in moratorium*")
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Death Penalty within U.S. Census Regions",
    subtitle = "Data includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia",
    caption = "*death penalty is legal but currently under governor's moratorium",
    x = NULL,
    y = "percentage of states",
    fill = NULL
  )
```

Do you notice any pattern in regions regarding proportions of states that do and do not have the death penalty?

##

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 9}
USstates <- map_data("state")
data %>%
  mutate(state = tolower(state)) %>%
  full_join(USstates, by = c("state" = "region")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = dp2), color = "black") +
  coord_map(projection = "mercator") +
  scale_fill_brewer(
    palette = "Set2",
    labels = c("no death penalty", "death penalty", "in moratorium*")
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "top"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Which states in the U.S. have the death penalty?",
    subtitle = "Note: Alaska and Hawaii do not have the death penalty.",
    caption = "*death penalty is legal but currently under governor's moratorium",
    fill = NULL
  )
```

Do you notice any pattern in states that do and do not have the death penalty?

##

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.cap = "Figure Caption: This plot type is known as a Cleveland dot plot."}
data %>%
  filter(!is.na(abolished)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = abolished, y = reorder(state, -abolished))) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 1976,
    linetype = "dashed",
    size = 0.75,
    color = "darkgray"
  ) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = state), xend = 0, colour = "black") +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_label(aes(label = "Furman v. Georgia 1976", x = 1945, y = "Wisconsin")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 1800, to = 2040, by = 20)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12.5),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "How long ago did U.S. states abolish the death penalty?",
    subtitle = "23 states and D.C. have abolished the death penalty as of April 2022",
    x = "year the death penalty was abolished",
    y = NULL
  )
```

What is Furman vs. Georgia 1976 and why would I put it on this plot? Do you see any interesting patterns?

##

```{r}
outlierlabels <- data %>%
  arrange(desc(post1976)) %>%
  select(state, post1976) %>%
  head(n = 1)

ggplot(data, aes(x = post1976, y = 1)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(
    width = 0.05,
    fill = "orange",
    outlier.size = 2
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = outlierlabels,
    aes(x = post1976, y = 1.05, label = state)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 600, by = 50),
    limits = c(0, 600)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Executions per State Since 1976",
    x = "total number of executions",
    y = NULL
  )
```

Wow, Texas --- what's up?!? Who are those smaller outlier states?
